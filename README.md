FIND ME A PATH PROJECT

Problem: 

Given up to 100,000 nodes, use various shortest path methods to find the least distance path between two nodes.

Motivation: 

When traveling anywhere, one wants to save the most amount of time to get from spot A to B. This can be whether it's walking on campus or traveling around the world. The nodes and paths can be scaled representations of walkways in a park, roads in a city, or flight paths globally.

Features: 

Users will generate up to 100,000 random nodes, be able to select a starting location and an ending location, choose a shortest path algorithm method, and compare if each method gives them the same shortest path with similar time. As well as finding the shortest path in general.

Data: 

The data will be generated as a graph with distances between nodes, or null if they are not connected.
Tools: This project will be coded in C++. We plan on finding a visualizer that fits our needs to display the graph as well as the path. 

Visuals: 

We would like to find a method of creating a visual for this project. We will search online for tools that we can use. If we do not find online tools, our other option is to have the program generate the node points and have a line drawn between the points. However, visual is not essential to the project. The command prompt can also return the ID of the nodes that create the shortest path. 

Strategy:

The nodes will create a distance graph matrix, three types of shortest path methods will be implemented to find the shortest path. These three types are Dijkstra, Floyd Warhsall, and Bellman-Ford.

Distribution of Responsibility and Roles: 

Each member will be required to spend about 15 hours working on this project. Moving through this project a list of what needs to get done will be created, and team members will put their names for the task to complete. Sebastian and Ethan will mainly work on creating the code for the shortest path methods. Christian will mainly work on the randomized creation of the distance graph matrix. Semion will assist on the shortest path methods, but mainly focus on finding a way to visually create the project and other features such as choosing the desired nodes, calculating run time, etc.
